# Web Unleashed 2014 - New Shiny in ES6

* [Presentation slides for Web Unleashed](http://marcoscaceres.github.io/web-unleashed-2014/#/)

# Topics 

  * New syntax and operators
  * Language primitives including sets, maps, and iterators
  * Generators – what they are, when you might use them
  * Promises – escape callback hell

# Overview

This talk aims to give an overview of the new syntax, operators and primitives in ES6. I discuss some of the new syntax, such as the, const, let, and fat arrow; and new ways that simplify looping over collections. I also cover new object primitives (sets and maps), as well as promises: what they are and how you can use them to write cleaner, more comprehensible and maintainable async code. I discuss generators, and how they can help you encapsulate and simplify common coding patterns. 

# Target Audience
 * This talk is for Web/Node developers.
