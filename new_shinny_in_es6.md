# New shinny in ES6

# Me
* I work for Mozilla
* I'm part of the DOM team
* I work on designing new features for the Web
* Working for Mozilla, get to use ES6 on projects
* I'm going to cover that I've found useful

# Follow along
* DONT EVERYONE START DOWNLOADING!
* If you have Nightly or Chrome Canary, you can follow along
* Remember, for Chrome ‚ÄúExperimental JavaScript Features‚Äù in chrome://flags
* open up your console.
* Going to try to keep code really concise.
* I'll let you know on each slide if it works in Chrome or Firefox

## So much awesome
* There is so much awesome, can't possibly cover it all
* Can only scratch the surface.
* This talk is mostly focused on developers building on Browsers.
* You can apply this stuff to Node, of course. But it's not a 1:1.

# Bad news
* Most of the stuff I'm going to show doesn't work cross browser
* I'll display logos for where it works/doesn't
* I also lied. Wont be covering:
	* Modules or classes
  * Will probably be like 2 years before you can use em.

# New syntax and operators

 * `const`, `let`, `for ... of`, and the spread
 * parameter defaults
 * fat arrow
 * rest paramenters
 * destructuring
 * method definitions

## Problem


===

## Problem of variable scope

* the problem in ECMAScript is that scope
* You are constantly leaking varibles
* this is great for closures, but it sucks because other code can
	* trash your variables
	* makes things difficult to debug (information overload)

## Variable scoping


var outterVar = "I'm a var!"
let outterLet = "I'm a let!"

(function(){

	//prints "I'm a var!", undefined
	console.log(outterVar, outterLet)

}());

## Variable Scoping advances



(function(){
    //only in this scope
    let x, y, z;

    //to all shared scopes
    var a, b, c;

    function internalFunction(){
        //has access to only a, b, c!
    }

}());


## Block example
* what if you only want to declare a varible in it's own scope?
* ES has you covered - no need for a function
* only works in Firefox

var fruit = "apple",
	juice = "";

let(veg = "carrot"){
    juice = veg + " " + fruit;
}
veg; //error, not defined!


## Using let in a Loop

* for when you loop over multiple arrays
* it's easy to screw up and use the wrong variable
* Wouldn't it be great if we could use `i` always for iterators

var fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
var meats = ["beef", "bacon", "beef", "bacon"];
var deserts = ["cake", "ice cream"];

for(var i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++ ){
	for(var j = 0; j < meats.length; j++ ){
		for(var k = 0; k < deserts.length; k++ ){
		   console.log(i, j, k)
		}
	}
}


var fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
var meats = ["beef", "bacon", "beef", "bacon"];
var deserts = ["cake", "ice cream"];

for(let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++ ){
	var fruit = fruits[i]
	for(let i = 0; i < meats.length; i++ ){
		var meat = meats[i];
		for(let i = 0; i < deserts.length; i++ ){
		   let desert = deserts[i];
		   console.log(fruit, meat, desert)
		}
	}
}


## Let

* let allows you to declare a varible in a block scope

```
function(){
   var adjective = ["pretty", "ugly"]

}

```

===

## Problem: iteration


## for...of
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of





# Problem: destructuring assignment

* sometimes you have to process an object that has more info than you need.






## rest paremeters
[rest paremeters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)


```
function(a, b, ...args) {

}
```

## Problem: working with string


## template strings

* help overcome a bunch of annoyances in Javascript
	* no multi line support - you have to repeat variables over and over
	* string concatination is annoying




## Meet the backtick "`"

* backtick is your new best friend.
* backticks allow you declate a template string

## Fat arrow

Sick of funcktions!

*


## Gotchas?



## Destructuring


## Method definitions

http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/03/es6-and-method-definitions.html

```

```

====
# Sets

* sets allow you create collections whose items are guarranteed to be unique.
*

## WeakSet

*

====
# Maps


## WeakMap
* weak reference


=========
# Promises

 üîú

## Use case

"Deferred asynchronous operations"


* "I would like a coffee"
Barista: "sure, comming right up!"

<time passes>

* "Here you go!"

<Barrista problems>

  * "oh crap! we are out of milk!"
  * "oh crap! we are out of coffee!"
  * "oh crap! the machine is not working!"
  * "oh crap! I hate this guy. I simply refuse."

So:

<del>"Deferred asynchronous operations"</del>
<ins>One and done!</ins>

## States
* pending
* fulfilled
* rejected

# One and done!

# One of us!

# Let's make a promise

```
var barista = {
  skills: new Set(['Americano', 'mocha', 'latte']),
  make(type = 'Americano') {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
      if (!this.skills.has(type)){
       let msg = `Don't know how to make a ${type}`;
       return reject(msg);
      }
      setTimeout(()=>{
        (Math.round(Math.random())) ?
          resolve(`Here's your ${type}`) :
          reject(`I'n not making YOU a ${type}`);
      }, 1000 * Math.random());
    });
  }
}

barista.make().then(
 (msg) => console.log(msg,"thanks!"),
 (err) => console.log(err, "well! thanks for nothing!")
);



## Ordering for friends

* imagine you had gone to the cafe with your friends
* You want to place and order for 4 coffees
*


## Coping with exceptional circumstances
* What happens if our barista suddenly rage quits?
* I.e., what happens in "exceptional" circustances.
* Normally, we deal with these situations with try catch blocks*
* But promises swallow


## Promise.resolve()

## Promise.reject()

## Promise.all(iterable)



    Language primitives including sets, maps, and iterators
    Generators ‚Äì what they are, when you might use them
    Promises ‚Äì escape callback hell
    Classes and modules ‚Äì restructure how you think about coding JS

## When do you use them?

* Don't go "promising" eveything.
*
"One and done"
